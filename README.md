# Inventario Mod

Modernized Inventory System using PocketBase and React.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Running the Application
Use the main `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- **PocketBase** (Backend) on `http://localhost:8090`
- **Frontend** (React) on `http://localhost:5173`

## Legacy Files
Legacy configuration files (e.g., `docker-compose.modern.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`) have been moved to the `_archive/` directory.

## Development
Refer to `.agentic_rules/MASTER_RULES.md` for development protocols.
